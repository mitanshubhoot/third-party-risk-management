## üìã Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js 20.18.1 or higher (Required)
- npm 8.0.0 or higher
- Ruby (for WhatWeb component)
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)

## üöÄ Detailed Installation Steps

1. **Install Node Version Manager (nvm)**
   ```bash
   curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
   ```
   After installation, close and reopen your terminal, or run:
   ```bash
   export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
   [ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"
   ```

2. **Install the Required Node.js Version**
   ```bash
   nvm install 20
   nvm use 20
   ```

3. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mitanshubhoot/third-party-risk-management.git
   cd third-party-risk-management
   ```

4. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Navigate to the subdomain scanner directory
   cd subdomain-scanner
   
   # Clean npm cache and install dependencies
   npm cache clean --force
   npm install
   ```

5. **Start the Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The application will be available at http://localhost:3000

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

1. **"Unsupported engine" Warning**
   If you see this warning, it means you're using an incompatible Node.js version. Follow steps 1-2 above to install the correct version.

2. **Port 3000 Already in Use**
   Start the server on a different port:
   ```bash
   npm run dev -- -p 3001
   ```
