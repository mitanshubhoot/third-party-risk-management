## Running the Application

1. Start the development server:

   By default, the server will try to run on port 3000. If that port is in use, you can specify a different port:
   ```bash
   npm run dev -- -p 3002
   ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to:
   - If using default port: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
   - If using custom port: http://localhost:[PORT]

## Usage

1. Enter a domain name in the input field (e.g., example.com)
2. Click "Scan" to start the security analysis
3. The tool will:
   - Enumerate subdomains
   - Perform security checks
   - Generate a comprehensive report
4. View results in the interactive dashboard
